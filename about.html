                        <h4>About</h4>I appreciate you taking the time to get to know me

                        <h5>Beginning</h5>
                        <p>
                            I began my journey into the world of programming in August of 2016 at the advice of a
                            friend. He knew I enjoyed computers and told me to check out codeacademy.com. I started with
                            a JavaScript course. I then moved on to SQL, Java, Python, and every other free course I
                            could find.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After learning from codeacademy for a few months, I transitioned to Udemy courses, as well as other web
                            resources. My friend suggested that if I learned C# development, I could potentially work at
                            his company, sugra-sym.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In June of 2017, I began my career in technology at sugra-sym, a C#/.NET custom software
                            shop based out of Indianapolis, IN.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Working with a small startup doing Xamarin development, after about 9 months of
                            online courses, felt like being throw into the deep end of the pool. It was a
                            tremendous learning opportunity, one for which I am very thankful. I got to develop with
                            extremely talented
                            individuals, work on cool products, and gain experience with tools like Redgate, LINQ,
                            MSSQL,
                            WordPress, and Microsoft Visual Studio.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I walked away from that experience realizing that I wanted to receive some formal training
                            in software development. I enrolled in a Computer Science program at Ivy Tech.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I had previously researched Eleven Fifty Academy, a coding bootcamp in Fishers, Indiana, and
                            was connected with a recruiter on LinkedIn. Several months after enrolling in Ivy Tech, I
                            saw a post about a scholarship I qualified for at Eleven Fifty and enrolled immediately!
                        </p>

                        <h5>Eleven Fifty Academy</h5>
                        <p>
                            Eleven Fifty Academy is a non-profit coding bootcamp based in Fishers, IN. Their curriculum
                            includes .NET, Python, and JavaScript technology stacks. I attended a
                            fullstack JavaScript program from August 2018 through November
                            2018.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The 3-month program begins with pre-work, to be completed before we actually begin. The
                            pre-work consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Much of the pre-work is reviewed in the
                            first 3 weeks, also known as "Gold Badge".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After Gold Badge, those who qualify are graduated to the next level, which is "Blue Badge".
                            Blue Badge consisted of learning React.js and Node.js through lectures, exercises, Gitbooks,
                            Official Documentation, Stack Overflow, and our fellow students. Throughout this period, my
                            class of almost 30 students leaned on each other heavily and developed more than just
                            software([insert joke about human relationships and bonding])...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I developed the Getstruments web application for my Blue Badge project. As a musician, the
                            idea of using technology to resource-share music equipment, like AirBnB or Uber for guitars,
                            seemed perfect. I am proud of this project because it was the first full CRUD application I
                            built by myself, beginning to end.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Following Blue Badge, those who meet the requirements are advanced to the next stage. Red
                            Badge is focused on developing your team-development skills. During Red Badge, my team and I
                            built two Single-Page Applications(SPAs) using Angular 2+, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.
                            We also used Agile methodolgy, GitHub, Slack, and Trello.
                        </p>

                        <h5>AAES, Freelance, &amp; Pathfinder</h5>
                        <p>
                            Eleven Fifty Academy is full of brilliant individuals. I was lucky enough to briefly form a
                            startup with 3 of them. AAES Software was a group we formed to solve a very specific pain
                            point in the medical industry. We prototyped a mobile application using React-Native, Expo,
                            and MaterialUI.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to working with AAES, I started Unfolding Software LLC. I currently offer
                            freelance development services for Salesforce.com, Looker, AWS, JavaScript, Web Development,
                            and more. Please contact me today if you are looking for a talented developer on a contract
                            basis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a result of graduating from Eleven Fifty Academy, I got access to the Salesforce
                            Pathfinder program. The Pathfinder program is designed with Deloitte to introduce Developers
                            and Administrators into the Salesforce ecosystem. The program, which is about 12 weeks long,
                            consists of online Trailhead content, in-person events and training, webinars, and a case
                            study. I chose the Developer track and obtained my PD1 certification a few weeks after
                            graduating.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Open MarTech &amp; Today</h5>
                        <p>
                            In April of 2019 I began working remotely with the Indianapolis-based startup, Open MarTech.
                            Open MarTech is using AI and Machine Learning to revolutionize the marketing industry. In my
                            role as a Data Science intern, I use the Looker platform to create reports, dashboards, and
                            custom data visualizations for our clients. Additionally, I am developing on the AWS
                            Platform with Python, Lambda, EC2, API Gateway, CloudWatch, and Amazon Redshift.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Towards the end of June I obtained my Salesforce Platform Developer I certification. I am
                            currently studying for AWS Cloud Practictioner.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After obtaining my AWS Cloud Practictioner certification, I will work to obtain my CompTIA
                            Network+. Once I have a CompTIA certification, I will qualify for, and enroll in WGU's
                            Information Technology program(B.S.).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am currently seeking fulltime employment. Please contact me today if you are looking to
                            add a talented developer to your team!
